# The solid waste experience

Students have been collecting beach litter samples in Saint Sulpice, on the shore of Lake Geneva since 2016. This is the record 
of that experience. Their data has contributed to federal and regional reports that help others make decisions and inform the public.
The methods for assessing shoreline litter contamination were first tested with the students before being included in [IQAASL](https://hammerdirt-analyst.github.io/IQAASL-End-0f-Sampling-2021/) and
[Pla'stock](https://associationsauvegardeleman.github.io/plastock/index.html). Our focus is on the data generating process and how we can consider the data in the context of that process.

## The data generating process

We are talking about trash. An object of no monetary value that has reached the end of its useful life. The processes put
place to dispose of it have been averted. The object is now in the environment, it should not be. We are counting its occurrence. 

Careful consideration of the surrounding economic environment reveals a vast network of products and services designed to 
prevent objects from entering the environment. This system is complex and has different domains like prevention, recycling, 
education, engineering and finally removal and disposal. 

Ultimately, the object counts are failures of the system in place. However, If you take a purely statistical approach 
(how many cigarettes get smoked compared to the number we find) it is a wonder there is not more.  

## Financial disclosure

This has never been funded by any organization. The students have been volunteers. The data is open and free to use.
