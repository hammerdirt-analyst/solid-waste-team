# Trash: Here and Now

## Draft 

Notes and calculations for a manuscript about assessing beach litter data from one municipality over time from 2015 - 2022. *The changes in beach litter density over time are asessed by considering the results from the most recent regional survey. Two methods are explored to determine the probability and magnitude of the expected density of beach litter. One mucipality, Saint Sulpice, on Lac Léman is surveyed every year by students of the EPFL. Their have been three large scale campaigns in the Léman region since sampling started at Saint Sulpice, this includes 35 different locations from > 20 municipalities. The most recent campaign dates from 2022 by the Association pour la Sauvegarde du Léman. The sampling campaigns were conducted by very distinct groups using the same protocol.*

## Purpose

Demonstrate the utility and appilcability of observational data to envrironmental assessment process for managing public spaces. Beach litter data is chosen beacuse there is a rich data set of independent observations. In the region of interest there are 250 samples representing the number of objects found from a list of 230. Anthropolgists should delight. Plastics and toxicity is a peristent topic that the industry can not seem to shake. In this regard the EU has opted for the principle of precaution, establishing a recomended limit of ~ 20 piece of trash per 100 meters. Municipalities manage the resources for preventing and reducing plastics in our water, they must have a tool to aid the decision making process. This tool should be evidenve based, easy to replicate and interpret.

This demonstration amounts to the accounting of the interaction of multiple varaibles and a data set that can only be described as highly variable at most levels of aggregation. The EPFL students provide an everchanging but constant population type amongst the multitude of actors that are associated with can what only be called: _The litter industry_. Observations from groups like the WWF, EPFL, ASL or smaller local groups should not be excluded from the assessment process. In reality, they gain in value when compared to other groups or regions, this is demontrated in the first section.

The methods applied in the second section seek to model the experience of the surveyor or the attentive beachgoer. Thus, to model one survey total for one location implies that all possible values of the 230 different objects should be modeled for that one location. It is assumed that there is an exchange between the lake and shoreline. The land use adjacent to the survey location is considered another source of objects on the beach. 


## Introduction

To better control (eliminate) trash in the environment it is essential that the limited resources that are attributed to this domain be used as efficiently as possible. Correctly identifying zones of accumulation and or the objects that are accumulating in the watershed would enable more coordinated and precise actions between stakeholders. The process of identification needs to fulfill certain operating requirements to be effective:

* accurate
* repeatable
* scale-able (up and down)

Beach-litter data is `count` data. Gathered by volunteers following a protocol, the data is highly variable for many reasons. In most studies the median is less than the mean and in the case of the data for this study, the standard deviation is greater than the mean. Statistical tests dependent on linear relationships may not be appropriate, the guide from the JRC suggests using a Negative binomial distribution for modeling extreme events.
