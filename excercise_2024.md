# How did it get there?

Today, weâ€™re looking at how plastics, an essential part of modern life, ends up on the beach of Lake Geneva. 

In december 2022 the Association for the Safeguard of Lake Geneva (ASL) completed a year-long project of identifying and
quantifying trash on the beaches of Lake Geneva [Pla'stock](https://associationsauvegardeleman.github.io/plastock/index.html). 
This project was the latest in a series of initiatives that have been ongoing since 2015. These reports provide information 
about the quantity and type of objects found. However, they do not provide information about how the objects got to the beach.

__Todays schedule:__

1. Introduction
2. Discussion of what we expect to find
3. Field experience: identify and count 
4. Return to lab - tabulate results
5. Discussion of results

## Most common items

Among the most common items found on the lakes beaches in 2022 are the usual suspects: cigarette butts (11% of the total), plastic bottle caps, (4% of the total) 
and snack wrappers (8% of the total). We find also objects that are not associated with activities at the beach. For example, fragmented plastics (41% of the total)
industrial plastic pellets (6% of the total), cotton swabs (4% of the total) plastic construction materials (3% of the total) and shotgun cartridges (1% of the total).

All the previous items mentioned are found in similar proportions in the marine environment in the european space, [EEA data viewer](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/maps-and-charts/marine-litterwatch-data-viewer-marine-litterwatch-data-viewer).
The federal report of 2021, [IQAASL](https://hammerdirt-analyst.github.io/IQAASL-End-0f-Sampling-2021/), included medical containers, straws and stirrers and toys as common objects on the beaches of lake Geneva.

## First encounters

**Objective : in the field identify and count specific beach litter items.**

### Items of interest

The guide for monitoring beach litter, [MLW Guide](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC83985), lists 200 items that can be found on the beach. The OSPAR 
commission has a similar list of 150 items [OSPAR](https://www.ospar.org/documents?v=44122). Today we are going to focus on identifying and counting 7 items:

1. Plastic medical containers
2. Cotton swabs
3. Shotgun cartridges / wadding
4. Construction plastics
5. Industrial pellets
6. Media filters / biomass holders
7. Straws and stirrers

All other objects will be collected and discarded. Each item on the list has a distinct use or origin. 

### Tabulate results

Record the number of each item found and the name of the beach where it was found. Reflections:

1. Did you find more or less than you expected?
2. How do the results compare to the federal report of 2021?
3. Were there items that were found on one beach and not another?

### Discussion 

1. Did you notice any immediate sources of the items found? If so were their any visible signs of prevention measures?
2. If the source is not apparent, what are the possible sources?
4. What are the possible pathways for the object to reach the beach?
5. What are the possible prevention measures?

## Results

_Legend :_ The cumulative results are the total number found on visits to the two beaches since 2016 up to the day before of the excercise.

### Probability of finding an amount

_Legend :_ The historical probabilities (prior to field excercise) of finding a given quantity at the beaches surveyed (results combined):

## Semester project: pathways

You can choose to make your video project on the potential pathways to the beach of a specific item. Your video project should also include
a video short (think tiktok or google shorts) that can be shared on social media and give a brief overview of the problem and potential solutions.
